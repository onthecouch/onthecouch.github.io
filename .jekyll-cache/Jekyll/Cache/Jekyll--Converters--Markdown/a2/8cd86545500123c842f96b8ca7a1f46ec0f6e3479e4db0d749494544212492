I"Ñ<p>In this post, I will show you how to create a PowerShell profile and configure how PowerShell start. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.2">What is PowerShell?</a> Read that from the MSDN. Iâ€™m not gonna post about what is PowerShell? or something like the history of powershell to make this post looks like a wall of text, while you can read that on official microsoft documentation or just google it.</p>
